				<h2>Biocaching</h2>
				<p>Biocaching is an online game in which the objective is to identify and document observations of plants, animals and other life forms out in the field.</p>
				<p>All types of species have value in the Biocaching game: plants, birds, mammals, insects, mushrooms, fishes; any species you come across. You start by taking a photo so that the species can be identified. An observation also includes the time and place and may optionally include other information, such as the number of individuals, a comment, gender, size, color and age or stage.</p>
				<p>After the observation is submitted in the game, you are rewarded with points. Players may get additional points for the amount of information submitted, being the first to observe a species in an area, to have observed all species within a predefined group, or other achievements. Players will also be able so see and interact with other players' observations, through comments and likes, which in turn can provide points.</p>
				<p>Observations will be forwarded to national and international databases for biodiversity observations. As such playing the Biocaching game is a contribution to research and environment monitoring.</p>
				<p>Biocaching has won several Open Data awards and has been recognized by the United Nations and governments. It's currently developed by  me, Alice Polenghi, Bj√∏rn Hjelle and Peter Bremer.</p>
