<p>I haven't worked on any open source projects during this day, but I have learned a lot…</p>
<br />
<p>Sometimes when I’m learning something new I can work on something for hours and still I get nowhere. I just keep “googling”(“DuckDuckGoing”) and checking for solutions at Stackoverflow… Some hours was like that today, but after just one successful thing it all changed now after even more hours I have done a lots of work on my new training log. PHP maybe isn't my favorite language yet but I think PHP and I now can be friends. </p>
<br />
<p>I should post a “weekly update” on sundays in the future? </p>
<p>Now it’s time for german learning, a language that I have been trying to learn for years… I wonder what my teacher thinks is inside my brain ;-) </p>
