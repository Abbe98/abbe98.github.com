So after a week working with [Jekyll][4], this new blog is somewhat ready for use. I will probably do changes to the site every week until summer, I have already things on the “todo” list for this blog.

Learning Jekyll wasn't as expected, I did run into several problems just because I had no idea of what I was doing, but with some explanation from the open source community the solutions was never far away and now I know how Jekyll works. You can find the old site under “Projects” in the menu, I won’t keep it there for long… 

So do you want to follow along on my destiny to mess around with web standards, web accessibility and open source? Follow me on [Google+][3], [Twitter][2] or using [RSS][1].
