I got home late yesterday after an entire weekend at [Hack4FI - Hack your heritage](http://hack4.fi/) in Helsinki. This was a very different hackathon for me, because I was there as a part of Wikimedia Finlands Wikidata project and had no intention at all to work on any specific project. The only aim I had was to promote Wikidata/Wikimedia and help with actual technical things as much as I could.

I found myself in a total new position where I was the person people pointed at if anyone had questions and the person people from different institutions ask about Wikidata/Wikimedia. I tried my best answering everyone and helping people create integrations. I know that we got a few people working on bots and integrations and a few organizations/institutions to start using Wikidata. I'm hoping I can continue be a support for both the organizations and individual developers, if I don't know the answer to a question that just means that I will learn something new and that's what I love!

I'm happy to see so many museums and other institutions opening up, many of them seams to have the process of copy and pasting values from a spreadsheet into Wikidata and Wikimedia Commons, aka there is a need for huge need for GLAM developers!

### Ajapaik2Commons

Actually I did a bit of actual coding for a project. [Ajapaik2Commons](https://github.com/Abbe98/ajapaik2commons) could be completed in just two hours and was a nice way of ending the weekend. Ajapaik2Commons is a tool for taking a rephotograph from [Ajapaik.ee](http://ajapaik.ee/) and publish it on Wikimedia Commons with all of its meta data. Ajapaik2Commons is based on the [Mapillary2Commons](https://tools.wmflabs.org/mapillary-commons/mapillary2commons/) tool made by Andr√© Costa and it uses the [URL2Commons](http://tools.wmflabs.org/url2commons/index.html) tool by Magnus Manske behind the scenes. It can be used by other tool passing a Ajapaik id through a URL parameter. 

Currently it's isn't online, I'm going to publish it on the Tool Labs Server as soon as I got the time to look into how it works(got access almost direct after my request, amazing admins!), maybe I have the time on Wednesday!

Special thanks to [Wikimedia Finland](http://wikimedia.fi/) who made my participation possible! Keep on learning together everyone!
