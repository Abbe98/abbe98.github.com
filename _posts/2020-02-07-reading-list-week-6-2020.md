I haven't done a weekly reading list on this blog since high school; this week I did for a mysterious unknown reason. Alternative title\: Links with random mumblings.

### GLAM and MuseTech

 - [Building Wellcome Collection’s new archival storage service](https://stacks.wellcomecollection.org/building-wellcome-collections-new-archival-storage-service-3f68ff21927e) – Two too common issues: filenames consisting of identifiers that are forgotten sice long ago and file verification. Current efforts will save future developers and archivists at Wellcome one headache or two.
 - [Someone used neural networks to upscale a famous 1896 video to 4k quality](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/02/someone-used-neural-networks-to-upscale-a-famous-1896-video-to-4k-quality/) – I have had the pleasure to work a bit with colorization and upscaling at work. It raises interesting questions about authenticity.
 - [Engaging Absence](https://www.thomaspadilla.org/2018/02/26/engaging-absence/) – Do not only consider the data that you do not have but also present and represent it?
 - [Digitale handlingsmønstre i kunst- og museumssektoren](https://www.bi.no/globalassets/forskning/centre-for-creative-industries/publications/dnd-rapport-nr.-5.-digitale-handlingsmonstre-i-kunst--og-museumssektoren---om-forbrukere-museumsledere-og-kunstnere.pdf) – How Norwegian museum audiences use and interact with museums digital offerings. The first part I think is quite errorsome because of selection bias not taken into acount the rest is interesting but contains nothing revolutionary.

### Accessibility

 - [Why You Should Choose HTML5 \<article> Over \<section>](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/01/html5-article-section/) – Even if the title doesn't teach you something new, the article will still show an actual useful use of the \<section> element.
 - HTML attributes to improve your users' two factor authentication experience https://www.twilio.com/blog/html-attributes-two-factor-authentication-autocomplete – As often with web accessibility/usability things, what's details to developers aren't necessarily details for your users.
 - [Making Memes Accessible](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308561.3353792) – Intresting problem; I'm however sligthly sceptical against the implementation. Partial image hashing could be a better solution to matching images maybe?

### Other

 - [Old CSS, new CSS](https://eev.ee/blog/2020/02/01/old-css-new-css/) – Long write up about CSS and its past and current hacks.
 - [The Best Little Museum You Never Visited in Paris](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/best-little-museum-you-never-visited-180956025/) – The Museum of Arts and Crafts in Paris does now have an entry in my notebook.
 - [Semikolon: nio exempel!](https://lotten.se/2020/01/semikolon-atta-exempel.html) – I have tough feelings about semicolons; it's potentially useless.
