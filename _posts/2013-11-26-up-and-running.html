title: Up and running!

<p>So after a week working with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, this new blog is somewhat ready for use. I will probably do changes to the site every week until summer, I have already things on the “todo” list for this blog. 
Learning Jekyll wasn't as expected, I did run into several problems just because I had no idea of what I was doing, but with some explanation from the open source community the solutions was never far away and now I know how Jekyll works. You can find the old site under “Projects” in the menu, I won’t keep it there for long… </p>

	So do you want to follow along on my destiny to mess around with web standards, web accessibility and open source? Follow me on <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AlbinabbeLarsson">Google+</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/AlbinPCLarsson">Twitter</a> or using <a href="http://abbe98.github.io/atom.xml">RSS</a>.
