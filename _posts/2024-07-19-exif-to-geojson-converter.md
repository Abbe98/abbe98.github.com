I made a small tool for extracting EXIF location data and "converting" it into GeoJSON. It comes from my need to display EXIF locations in [OpenOrienteering Mapper](https://github.com/OpenOrienteering/mapper). Turns out it's useful for other things like OpenStreetMap mapping and Wikidata([WikiShootMe](https://wikishootme.toolforge.org/) supports custom GeoJSON layers).

You find the tool on [this webpage](https://byabbe.se/exif-to-geojson/) and the code over at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/abbe98/exif-to-geojson).
