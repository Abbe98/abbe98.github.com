Day five and the application now works as it should, so tomorrow code cleaning, on Sunday push to Github and on Monday back to school. Now you can register/upload maps, and you can browse them. 

That's it, over the past five days I have spent 5 hours on this project(totally) so I think it's okay that you can't edit or delete maps right now, probably I will push some updates while sitting on the bus in the coming weeks.

So tomorrow testing code cleaning and minor fixes.

Future features that I would like to add:

 - edit
 - delete
 - export(GeoJSON + embedding code)
 - custom icon markers
 - responsive design
 - option to disable transitions
 
Then I the "Mozilla" Blue sky too ;-)

Supported browsers right now are Opera, Chrome and IE10+ Firefox works but it can't handle all the CSS transitions...
