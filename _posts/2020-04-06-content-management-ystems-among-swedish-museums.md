I recently "visited some" museum websites to determinate which content management system or backend that powers them. Now I have published my dataset with over 370 Swedish museum websites (excluding those museums who uses central CMS solutions (such as hembygd.se or municipality websites)).

![Bar chart](https://byabbe.se/assets/cms-museums-sweden.svg)

Almost two thirds are powered by WordPress (general CMS marketshare estimated between 35-50%). Drupal, SiteVision, and Joomla! comes there after all powering less than  a dozen sites.

This homogeneous situation could have interesting applications but I will save those thoughts for a future post. [For now you can get the dataset and read more about it over at Figshare.](https://figshare.com/articles/Content_Management_System_s_Among_Swedish_Museums/12083994) It\'s licensed under CC0.
