Untill today Nyk&ouml;ping has been having the status of "decent". The list of cities in Sweden and their status can be found on the Wiki([WikiProject Sweden/Cities][1]). After many hours of mapping yesterday, I changed the status to "completed"(for car navigation). The description of the completed status states "All public roads should be mapped. Roads should be tagged with `name` and driving restrictions should be fully mapped.".

I decided when I saw the status table at the wiki yesterday that the task for the weekend should be to make sure that Nyk&ouml;ping could be given the status completed. I saw it as a easy task as we have been spending a loot of time on mapping buildings downtown but I did knew that some roads was missing names so I used the "[QA][2]" tool to check for roads without names. I think I added about 70 missing names, much more then I had thought of. I also discovered that in the eastern part of Nyk&ouml;ping there was black areas where roads were missing. The areas had no aerial imagery. I went to sleep late that night, mapping about 30 new roads without aerial imagery. I think the result become as good as it can be anyway.

The next parse in mapping Nyk&ouml;ping are we still discussing(we means me and another year one student at Nyk&ouml;pings Orienteering Gymnasium). We are working on a task list that we will maintain through Github(Pages+Mapbox+GeoJSON) so that everyone can see what we are working on and give us a helping hand.
