I did attend Slush a week ago, I had a great time, really liked some of the talks(The best one were by Christopher Fabian UNICEF) meet a lot of people that is both doing interesting things and though what I do is great.

The reason I got to Slush is as frequent readers of this blog know were the Nordic Open Data Challenge that the Biocaching project participated in(previous posts about Biocaching, [1](http://abbe98.github.io/blog/2015/07/01/hack4no/), [2](http://abbe98.github.io/blog/2015/08/17/biocaching/), [3](http://abbe98.github.io/blog/2015/10/25/biocaching-continues/)). 

Biocaching ended up being one of the three winning projects together width [Humans4Oceans](http://www.humansforocean.com/) and SpaceInvaders. I'm a fan of all project at the same time as I believe that all projects has major issues that has to be overcome.
