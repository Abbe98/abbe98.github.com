I just took the time to release [0.9](https://github.com/Abbe98/ksamsok-php/releases/tag/0.9.0) of my KSamsok-PHP library and to update the [documentation](https://byabbe.se/ksamsok-php/).

This release has breaking changes for those who extends the `KSamsok` class. This version brings increased speed and updated tests which are now connected to [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Abbe98/ksamsok-php). Also PHP type hints and modern array syntax is now in place.

Because of the major speed improvement this is a much recommended release. For those who are only using the existing methods and does not extend the core class no changes are needed. For everyone else, please note that the `prepareUrl()` and `validResponse()` methods has been removed. For more information see [extending KSamsok-PHP](https://byabbe.se/ksamsok-php/#extending) and the [breaking commit](https://github.com/Abbe98/ksamsok-php/commit/93cce0704c7dc34e464e9039c89d4d8468d881f3).
