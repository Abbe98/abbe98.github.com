title: Minor changes and future ones...
---
<p>So this webpage was a 30 minutes hack + some hours of bug fixes, for short I have a long list of “Todo”s…<br />But I have been doing two very small improvements…</p>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>Wrapped all of the posts inside a article element and not just in a div.</li>
	<li>Added Google Analytics</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>
	Nearly everything that I want to change or add, can I fix quite fast… But…
</p>
<br />
<p>
	This isn’t on my priority list, because I will probably rewrite the entire site during my christmas holidays(starting in a week)...
</p>
<br />
<p>
	Here is a list of those small things I would like to fix/add…
</p>
<br />
<ul>
	<li>About me page.</li>
	<li>New color scheme.</li>
	<li>Sidebar to display other posts.</li>
	<li>Social links somewhere.</li>
	<li>Images in posts.</li>
	<li>Custom OGP image for posts.</li>
	<li>Project page(not just the old page as I do provide for now).</li>
	<li>Share posts from startpage.</li>
	<li>Tags.</li>
	<li>New menu and footer.</li>
	<li>Fix post header on mobile.</li>
</ul>
...
<br />
<p>You got it?</p>
<p>Noway I will do that stuff if I’m planning to rewrite the site…</p>
<br />
<p>More about the “new site” in the coming week…</p>
<br />
<p>And I decided that I will release App Ground 1.1.2 before I publish the docs, so 1.1.2 later this week and the docs somewhere around christmas… </p>
