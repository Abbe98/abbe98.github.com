First blog post from my new apartment, moved in earlier today!

So what happened to my "[most awesome idea in the history of ice cream!][1]"?

To make the story short, my GPS watch didn't arrive in time, so it didn't work at all. It's sad but the race didn't go to well for me anyway. 

**Positive Thinking!**

Okey, I got some new friends which is always nice! It was a great and social event(whichin this case means "lakanskr√§ck"). I'm coming back next year and probably I will also go to another event(three days) in Oslo during 2015. I got my new GPS watch now ;-)
