Day two and to be honest, the only coding I have been doing was when I made lunch for me and my sister. The thing that I did write was a simple toggle function, to handle the interface, so the page does not haft to reload, when you want to register a new map location/event. Nothing advanced at all for short. 

The only time the map(and all other front-end) will be reloading is when you save a new map location/event, I could probably avoid this by using AJAX but I wont look into it, maybe later on if I get time for it. 

Tomorrow I will try to get all the inputs done so I can use the two last days to output the GeoJSON(P) in a working way and write some documentation needed for for publishing at github on friday :-)
