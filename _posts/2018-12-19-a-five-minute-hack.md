Click the link or type [runes.rocks](https://runes.rocks) into your web browser and you will be directed to a random article about a rune inscription or runestone. 

I love small ideas and experiments. They are cheap they scale from a few hours to a few moths. An example I'm often refer to is [Kyrksok.se a site we build a few years ago in lens then two days](https://byabbe.se/2016/11/12/kyrksok-se-and-wikidata). 

However [runes.rocks](https://runes.rocks) and the Swedish version [runor.rocks]((https://runor.rocks)) sets a new record. It took me five minutes to buy the domain names and everything up thanks to existing tools.

I bought domain names and pointed the redirect URL to [Magnus Manske](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Manske)'s [Random article tool](https://tools.wmflabs.org/magnustools/randomarticle.php) and waited for the name servers to update. Done.
