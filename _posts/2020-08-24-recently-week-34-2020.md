### Things

Took part in the [weekly competition on the Swedish Wikipedia](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Veckans_t%C3%A4vling/Videosprint_2) about adding video material to articles. In total, I added videos to 44 articles, thanks to the [Wikidata query service](https://w.wiki/Zcs).

Did a Wikidata live-stream with Jan again, I highlighted property [5991 "carbon footprint"](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P5991) hoping that usage will go up! You can watch [the recording on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txIBf7IA75w).

Following a two day hike this weekend I (finally (buried a hatch?)) got a [iNaturalist account](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/abbe98).

### Reading

[Wikimedia Foundation Annual Carbon Footprint Report](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2019_Wikimedia_Foundation_Annual_Carbon_Footprint_Report_-_June_30,_2020.pdf)


[Python Hash Tables: Understanding Dictionaries](http://thepythoncorner.com/dev/hash-tables-understanding-dictionaries/) - a dive into how Python dictionaries are built on top of hash tables.

[Jupyter Notebook REST API](https://ndres.me/post/jupyter-notebook-rest-api/) - While researching if there is an (easy) way to turn [papemill](https://github.com/nteract/papermill) notebooks into APIs if found [Jupyter Kernel Gateway](https://github.com/jupyter/kernel_gateway) which took me halfway to what I wanted.

[Apple VS Epic](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments) - This is such an interesting case. Well prepared lawsuit from a rich activist that wants to change the system while Apple in parallel faces investigations already. 

[New in PHP 8](https://stitcher.io/blog/new-in-php-8) - each time these "new in PHP" articles come around I get an urge to get back into some PHP development (other than MediaWiki), same this time.


### Cool things around the internet

[The Open Restitution Project](https://openrestitution.africa/) - This project looks to collect and aggregate restitution data from an African perspective. [They are currently looking for partners.](https://openrestitution.africa/support-our-work/)

### Final notes

"Recently" is a new format I'm trying out, inspired by my [reading lists](https://byabbe.se/archive.html) that have been up and down for years. The intention is to be broader and include things I and others have done that won't make it into a post on its own.
