Last weekend I found some time for some coding for fun and learning. I played around with the basics of the canvas API, a bit more of CSS and visual stuff then I usually do. I ended up creating a [site](https://byabbe.se/Mapillary-Custom-Leaderboards/) that allows Mapillary users to create their own custom leaderboards by just searching for participants and set a optional time frame.

I got some additional ideas that I might take on if there is a interest once school is over\:

 - Leaderboard Map View(Mapbox GL)
 - Select participants by location (Mapillary API v3 + Mapzen Search?)
 - Leaderboards limited to countries/bounding boxes.
 - Add avatars to Leaderboard(optional)
 - User pages

Speaking of school once the holiday is here I plan to learn and play around a bit more then usual with quite new frontend technologies. I'm looking at learning things about Webassembly, Service/Web Workers, HTML context menu API, WebVR and a bunch of other things, give me tip if there is anything specific you think I should share and try.
