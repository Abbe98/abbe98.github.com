I created one of those "awesome lists" for K-samsök resources, I have personally found awesome lists useful when starting with something new our just needs to investigate useful components a hobby project. Therefor I decided that it might help someone else to have one list for all the best K-samsök projects and resources so that people might get started quicker with one of Europe's largest Linked Open Data platforms for heritage data.
